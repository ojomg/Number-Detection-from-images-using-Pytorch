# Number-Detection-from-images-using-Pytorch

* Working with images in PyTorch (using the MNIST dataset)
* Splitting a dataset into training, validation, and test sets
* Creating PyTorch models with custom logic by extending the `nn.Module` class
* Interpreting model outputs as probabilities using Softmax and picking predicted labels
* Picking a useful evaluation metric (accuracy) and loss function (cross-entropy) for classification problems
* Setting up a training loop that also evaluates the model using the validation set
* Testing the model manually on randomly picked examples
